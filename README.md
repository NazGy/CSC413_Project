Sentiment analysis is referred to as text organization that is used to classify expressed sentiment polarities. While there are many models that can analyse sentiments, for the purpose of this paper, we will focus on an Attentional Encoder Network (AEN) that employs a BERT model and SMART model that includes a smooth-inducing adversarial regularization and a Bregman proximal point optimization. We will also compare the results with an off-the-shelf transformer. Our experiments show that the AEN and SMART models outperform an off-the-shelf transformer.
